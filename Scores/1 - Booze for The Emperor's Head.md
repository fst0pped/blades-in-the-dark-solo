Hoxley lets us know that there's a crate of the good stuff coming over from Skovland. Proper Skovish Skullsplitter. The Dockers can't just let this one fall off the back of the boat since it will be missed, but the Supervisor has made it known that it's in a specially marked crate, and that it would be a shame if it were to be stolen after it had left the custody of the dockworkers guild.

The score is to get hold of the skullsplitter and sell to the landlord of the Emperor's Head pub, who is hoping to attract the attention of some specialist clientele.

**Plan:** Deception
**Detail:** Hoxley knows this shipment is bound for [[LOCATION-Kellen's]], and the delivery driver is called Gerald.

**Roll 3d:** 4,5,4 - A risky start

The crew is in position a short way from the bridge from Docklands to Crow's Foot. The wagon is approaching and Kaslyn walks out to intercept.

**FlashBack:** Kaslyn wants to acquire a couple of Bluecoat uniforms for her and Zamira. This will hopefully help keep the driver distracted while the goods on the back of the wagon are 'inspected'. She'll **consort** with some local washerwomen to see if she can make some friends and grab a couple of uniforms out of the wash/off a drying line. **1 stress**
**Roll 2d:** 1,1 - Failure
She is seen poking around where the uniforms are being washed. She doesn't get hold of one and the local bluecoats get a description of her looking suspicious there. **+2 heat**.

She walks out in animated conversation with Zamira just as the wagon reaches them and tries to make it look as if she gets knocked down by the wagon without actually going under the horse. This will be a bit of a performance check, so a **sway**, but I think she'll need to carry Zamira whose reaction will be an important part of the performance, so Kaslyn will lead a group action.

**Roll 3d (Kaslyn):** 3,6,3
**Roll 0d (Zamira):**  2,4

**Success** but Kaslyn takes another **1 stress**.

The driver starts off shouting and swearing but is quickly convinced that he might actually have hurt someone. He jumps down for a closer look and Kaslyn keeps him busy as long as she can.

**Clock: Kaslyn keeps the driver busy**
oooo

Weaver walks up behind the carriage as quickly as he can and climbs onto the back. Trying to keep the noise down and **prowl**, though Kaslyn is doing a good job of keeping the noise high up front.

**Roll 0d:** 5,5 - Success with complication.

Weaver avoids arousing the suspicions of the carriage driver who remains distracted by the performance at the front, but this is a main road and the members of the public can see that he's climbed up on the wagon and definitely shouldn't be there. Like an idiot he's not wearing a mask. He is identifiable for the purposes of calculating Heat at the end of the job.

**Flashback:** Weaver wants to have arranged with the dockworkers to leave another crate on the back of the carriage full of regular ale, but labelled with Skullsplitter lables. Covered up so that the carriage driver can't see them. He doesn't have any coin to spend on bribes, so he promises them a share of the take. This is a **sway** but he has no points in that skill, so he pushes himself and takes **2 stress**. Maybe he's not much of a drinker, but he gets caught up in a round and has to stay much later than planned. 

**Roll 1d:** 2 - Failure

Weaver doesn't get his lookalike bottles, so it will be obvious that these have been taken when the wagon arrives at its destination.

**Flashback:** Weaver knows he'll need to either remove a crate from a wagon, or remove bottles from a crate. He has a 'bottle carrier' made up from Hessian with bottle sized compartments and plenty of padding sewn into it so he can transport the bottles quietly. No stress taken, this is pretty straightforward.

**Weaver marks 1 load of 6**: Custom sack

He starts moving bottles from the crate to his sack, again trying to keep the noise down with a **prowl**.

**Roll 0d:** 5,6 - Success with complication

The sack does an excellent job of drowning out the noise, but the carriage driver is starting to lose interest in Kaslyn's performance. He's got a job to do, and she's clearly not dying so now he just wants her out of the way.

**Clock: Kaslyn keeps the driver busy**
xooo

Weaver realises he has a bit more time than expected, so he tries to quietly break the empty crate in a way that suggests that it may have split and spilled its contents on the drive to its destination, hoping to give an alternative - if unlikely - explanation for how these bottles went missing. He pulls out a crowbar and goes to work loosening a panel on the side. He's going to try and **wreck** this crate, but with subtlety. He's also going to **push himself** to get this right, since it could go a long way to removing some of the heat from this job. **+1d**, **+2 stress**.

Zamira, subtly checking on Weaver's progress while aiding Kaslyn at the front, can see that he's taken out the crowbar and wants to help with this. She starts lambasting the driver for being more concerned with a couple of minutes journey time than the fact he may have done a permanent injury to this young actress. **+1d to Weaver's roll**.

**Weaver marks 2 load of 6**: Crowbar

**Roll 4d:** 6,5,4,3 - Success

Weaver does a nice job of splitting the crate open and leaves a single bottle hanging out precariously to really sell the story. He then decided its well past time he got out of here. He slips off the back of the carriage and walks away with the loot. As he goes, he glares at a couple of the spectators and mouths words to the effect that it will go badly for them if they tell anyone what they saw today. This will be an attempt at intimidation using his **command** to keep them quiet. He's going to **push himself** again to look as scary as possible, maybe getting up into a couple of faces on the way out.

**Roll 2d:** 5,4 - Success with complication

The people he targets with his glare look down, and he knows they won't say anything. A bit more of the heat from this score is diverted. But word will get back to the Bluecoats, and they'll put two and two together and work out that this is what the uniforms were intended for. **-1 faction relationship with The Bluecoats**, which takes us down to -2. They will actively be looking for ways to inconvenience us.

Seeing Weaver disappear between buildings, Zamira signals Kaslyn who starts winding up her performance. Zamira helps her up and they limp off.

### Payoff

We didn't really establish a target properly for this job - we're not going after a faction, but a specific pub in Charhollow territory. We'll say the injured part is *the citizens of Charhollow*, and in fact I'm going to retcon that final complication. The Bluecoats will definitely be unhappy with our Gang, but we'll add a new Tier 1 faction for the Charhollow citizenry and set them to -1 since we stole from thier local and much beloved pub [[LOCATION-Kellen's]].

We can then use the [[Downtime]] section of the new Deep Cuts rules to calculate the Payoff - 

|                  | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| payoff           | 1 Coin per PC, plus Coin equal to the target’s Tier x3                                                                                                |
| rep              | 1 Rep for every 2 Heat generated by the score.<br>+1 Rep per Tier of the target above the crew’s Tier                                                 |
| seized<br>assets | Take +4 Coin if you seize a load of cash. Very<br>valuable stolen items can be fenced for 2-8 Coin<br>(but you take 1 Heat for every 4 Coin of value) |

**Payoff:** PCs(1 x 3) + Tier (1 x 3) = **6 coin**

**Heat**:
- +2 for a standard criminal operation
- +4 if specific crew members were identified
= **6 heat**

**Rep:** Heat (1 x 3) + Tier (1) = **4 rep**
