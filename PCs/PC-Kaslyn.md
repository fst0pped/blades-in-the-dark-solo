**Special ability:** Subterfuge. May expend special armour to resist a consequence from suspicion or persuasion, or **push yourself** for subterfuge.

## Contacts
**Close Friend:** [[NPC-Klyra]]. Tavern owner in Charhollow. Sometimes lets Kaslyn play the pipes there.

**Rival:** [[NPC-Bryl]]. Ex-lover and journalist associated with the Ink Rakes who published a scathing review in revenge after being dumped and tanked her very promising acting career.

**Vice Purveyor:** [[NPC-Flint]]. Manager and director of the Moontide Theatre in Silkshore. There's not much money in theatre, but the actors will perform for beer money and exposure, and it keeps the theatre ticking over. There are always lines to learn, and turnover is so high there's always the chance for an understudy to take a headline.

## Looks
Woman. Curvy, light hair and broad shoulders indicate her Skovlan heritage. Everyday dress is shirt and trousers with the long style of scarf preferred by the acting community. Has started leaning more into her Skovlan heritage since the end of the war and the expansion of the Skovlan community in Doskvoll.
