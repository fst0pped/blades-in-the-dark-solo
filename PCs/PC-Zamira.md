## Background
 **Playbook:** Lurk
 **Heritage:** Iruvia. Water Bearers - family connections to an underground resistance movement fighting imperial occupation.
 **Background:** Roof runner, lookout scout and messenger. Initially for the Iruvian resistance, and they still get pro bono work sometimes, but it's a transferable skillset in Duskvol.

## Contacts
**Close Friend:** Vestine. A swordmaster at the Red Sash sword academy and mentor for resistance members.

**Rival:** Darmot. An Inspector tasked with bringing down the local resistance movement who always seems to be in the wrong place at the right time. 

**Vice Purveyor:** Arquo. Community outreach overseer at the Iruvian Consulate. Organises 'integration' events with the local community and charitable work in the poorer communities. Endless opportunities to volunteer - streetwork, paperwork, organisation, approaching local businesses. A real exercise in local soft power.

## Looks
Woman. Slim, fast, a gymnast's frame. Exotic looking, by Akorosian standards. Wears loose fitting clothing and a short cloak which can be pulled up as a hood when she wants to hide her face, and thrown back around her shoulders if she suddenly needs to run.
