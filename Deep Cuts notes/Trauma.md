This module makes the immediate consequence of Trauma less
severe and provides a different way to earn xp.
***
When you need to mark Stress, but all your boxes are marked, gain
a Trauma condition for your character, mark one of your Trauma
boxes, then remove all of your Stress. Circle a condition from the list
on your playbook (like Cold, Haunted, etc.) or create one of your own.

Describe your character’s Trauma reaction in the current circumstance,
based on the condition that you just chose. You decide how intense
this reaction is, and if it causes a problem for your character.

*During a brutal melee with the Red Sashes, Sean’s character,*
*Arcy Keel, overflows her stress track and marks a new Trauma:*
*Cold. Sean describes Arcy’s reaction in the moment — rather*
*than helping an injured ally (Bazso Baz of the Lampblacks), Arcy*
*leaves him behind to his fate in the hands of the enemy. “You’re*
*not my problem anymore,” she says.*

## Invoking trauma
Each of your characters Trauma conditions can be invoked once per
session to create a problem or complication for them. When you do
this, mark xp.

This replaces the end-of-session xp award for trauma. Only the player
may invoke their character’s trauma, not the GM or other players.

*Since Sean created a problem when he invoked Arcy’s new Trauma*
*condition — abandoning a valued ally to death or capture — he*
*marks xp.*

## retirement & recovery
When you mark your fourth Trauma box, your character retires. They
no longer have what it takes to live the life of a Scoundrel.

Before that, you may be able to recover from Trauma. Work with the
GM to create a long-term project (or other method) to remove one
of your conditions and clear a Trauma box. Each character’s Trauma
is personal, and the path to recovery should be, too.
