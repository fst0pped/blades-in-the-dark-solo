## ADVANCEMENT CLOCKS
Instead of using the current xp trackers on your playbook, draw a set of
four 6-segment advancement clocks. Do the same on the crew sheet.
Whenever you would mark xp, tick an advancement clock instead.

To acquire an advancement, fill a number of advancement clocks as
detailed below. When you gain the advancement, clear those clocks.

*If all of your clocks are filled, and you need to mark xp, just make an*
*additional clock to track it. “Extra” xp isn’t lost.*


| Advancement                                          | Clocks |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| New special ability from your playbook or crew sheet | 2      |
| Veteran special ability                              | 3      |
| Crew Upgrade (per box)1                              | 1      |
| Action or Attribute dot (see below)                  | 1-4    |
To add an Action or Attribute dot, you need
a number of filled advancement clocks equal
to the new rating. In the example at right, a
player adds a dot to Prowl, which raises its
rating to 2 — so it will cost 2 advancement
clocks to acquire

Another player wants to add a dot to Sway,
which raises their Resolve attribute to 2,
so they clear two of their full advancement
clocks and increase their Sway rating.
