This module changes how items are chosen before and during
the score.
***
Before the score, when you choose your plan for the operation, also
choose your character’s load style: conspicuous or discreet.
- Conspicuous: You have 6 boxes of items available. You may bring heavy items (any item that requires 2 or more boxes of load) but you must choose and mark heavy items before the score.
- Discreet: You have 4 boxes of items available. You may not bring any heavy items. You don’t  have to choose any items before the score.
### adding load during the score
If your Scoundrel picks something up during a score, you count it as
a marked load box. If you mark a 5th box, your character becomes
conspicuous — even if they were discreet when the score began.

If you mark a 7th box, your character becomes encumbered, and can
no longer climb, run, or swim unless they drop enough items to get
below 7 load. You can’t carry more than 9 boxes worth of load.

*During the score, Valkos finds a stash of Coin hidden in the*
*Billhook’s lair. Each Coin of cash counts as one load, so Abu marks*
*a box on Valkos’s sheet. This takes him to 5 boxes, so Valkos is*
*now conspicuous — he’ll draw attention when people see him*
