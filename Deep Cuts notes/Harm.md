You have space on your playbook to record two instances of level 2
Harm, and one instance of level 3 Harm. If you suffer Harm at a level
that has all instances filled, the Harm advances to the next highest
level of severity.

You may have an unlimited number of level 1 Harm conditions, but if
you suffer the same condition a second time, bump it up to level 2 —
e.g. if you’re Tired and you become Tired again, erase it and take level 2
Harm Exhausted instead. If your level 2 Harm instances are full, that’s
okay, just record another one — it doesn’t bump up to level 3 in this case.

## Invoking harm
Harm levels aren’t tied to specific mechanical penalties. Instead,
Harm may be invoked by the GM to impede the character, creating
a problem or limitation for them. When you invoke harm as the GM,
choose one:
- Introduce a bad outcome or new problem for the character. 
- Reduce an Action and/or Attribute rating for a roll. 
- Reduce the character’s position or effect.

When your character’s Harm is invoked, you mark xp. Feel free to
remind the GM of your character’s Harm when you think it might
apply to a situation.

*Joséphine’s character, Juliette, suffers level 3 severe Harm: ‘Broken
Ribs’ when a sparkwright bomb explodes and hurls her out a
window. The GM invokes her Harm to introduce a bad outcome:
Juliette is too injured to flee the scene without assistance. She’ll
have to get some help or talk her way out of this one. Joséphine
marks xp.

Ross’s character, Ekeprag Wodi, suffers a level 1 Harm condition:
‘Enthralled’ while Consorting in a house of pleasure. The GM
invokes this Harm to create a problem: Ekeprag is too engaged in
their dalliances to notice one of the hosts slipping away to inform
on the crew. Ross marks xp.

Abu’s character, Valkos, suffers level 2 Harm: ‘Concussion’ during
a tough brawl with the Billhooks. When the Bluecoats show up to
break up the gangs, another fight erupts. The GM invokes Valkos’
Harm to reduce his Prowess and associated Action ratings by 1
during the fight. Abu marks xp.

## Tough it out
If you think the consequence from an invocation of Harm is too
punishing or is just something you don’t want to deal with in the
game, suggest an alternative impediment and discuss it with the GM
or just tough it out: take 1 Stress per level of the Harm and draw a
line through it. You still have the Harm and need to recover from it,
but it can’t be invoked to impede you.

## Removing level 1 harm
Level 1 Harm represents temporary negative conditions that can
impede your character. Things like, Stunned, Tired, or Bloodied.

Some level 1 Harm conditions might require an action to remove. For
instance, if you’re Tired, you need to take some time to rest to remove
that Harm. If you’re Bloodied, you need to bandage your wounds.

Other types of level 1 Harm are removed when it makes sense in the
fiction. If you’re Intimidated by Bazso Baz, how long does that last?
Was is a one-time thing, or does it stick with you for a while? That’s
for the player to decide, based on how they portray their character.

Level 1 Harm conditions aren’t meant to last forever, though. After
being invoked a couple times, or when Downtime begins, remove
your level 1 Harm.

## Surviving fatal harm
If you suffer a mortal wound that isn’t instantly lethal, you may survive
if someone can treat the wound and stabilize you within a few minutes.
The fatal Harm remains on your playbook and must be dealt with
during a recovery activity. Also record a scar — a permanent injury
— like a limp, chronic pain, loss of an eye, etc.). You may invoke a scar
to impede your character and mark xp, as if it was Harm.
